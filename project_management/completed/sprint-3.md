## Sprint 3: High-Impact Typography & Final Deployment
**Goal:** Finalize the "Swiss" visual hierarchy, ensure functional navigation, and complete the production launch via GitHub Pages.

### 🎯 Tasks
- [x] **Typography Refinement:** Verified font weights (900 for name, 400 for body) to maintain the Swiss Grid standard.
- [-] **Functional Anchors:** Connect the "Systems Ledger" CTA to the `#ledger` ID for smooth-scroll navigation.
- [x] **Signal Color Implementation:** Apply **International Orange** (`#FF4F00`) to all interactive hover states.
- [x] **Infrastructure Fix:** Flattened directory structure to resolve GitHub Action "Exit Code 128" and enable deployment.
- [x] **Production Audit:** Verify the live URL on a mobile device to ensure the 12-column grid collapses correctly.

### Feedback 

- Add the systems ledger to meet sprint 3 goal.
- Reintroduce the technical category 
- Imporve process receipts
- Optimied white spaces

### Final Chnages 

- I decided to change the term "ledger" to a more general term like "Strategic work and analysis". The term "ledger" is a very specific term that is mostly used in accounting. I decided to not add the techincal category because I felt it was the same as "academic". I decided not to include process receipts. The only change that I accepted were the white spaces. I felt like like white spaces could be optimized to make the page look cleaner. 


### Acceptance Criteria
* Clicking the Hero CTA successfully jumps to the Project Archive.
* The site is live and accessible via the GitHub Pages production URL.
* Visual contrast and typography weights match the "Swiss Minimalist" Spec.
